1,Company Discussion,stocks,Thoughts on NDAQ purchasing Calypso/Adenza,8,0.83,"NDAQ has been outperforming the s&amp;p 500 for nearly a decade until now. When news of the deal purchasing Adenza (formerly calypso) broke the stock tumbled to $50

NDAQ says they are pivoting toward fintech rather than just exchange operation due to narrowing margins and limited growth. Not only did they purchase Adenza but they did so at what appears to be a very expensive price. Calypso was purchased by private equity for ~3.4b in 2021. Only 2 years later it was sold once more for 10.4b

I don't understand why they waited for 5% higher interest rates to buy this company instead of outbidding the private equity firm. Makes me mistrust management. I do not like roll-up companies, if NDAQs only way to grow is buying more companies at expensive prices I'd rather look elsewhere.

What are your thoughts on Adenza, can it contribute to NDAQ in such a way that it is worth the cost of debt?","Thoughts, NDAQ, Calypso, Adenza",NDAQ
2,Company Analysis,stocks,CIM-B: Higher for Longer,2,0.63,"As the market continues to price in higher interest rates for longer, there is opportunity in owning floating rate securities.  CIM-B is a preferred stock issued by Chimera Investment Corporation with a fixed rate coupon of 8.0%.  CIM-B trades at a 15% discount to par leading to a current rate of 9.4%.

On 3/30/24, 9 months from now, CIM-B switches to a floating rate security of 5.79% + 3m SOFR + 0.26%.  The 3m SOFR is the replacement for LIBOR and is currently at 5.26%.  That puts the floating rate coupon at 11.3%.  At the current price of $21.34, the yield would be 13.2%.

My investment thesis is that CIM-B moves to its par value of $25 over the next 9 months.  I think there will be $1.50 in dividends and $3.66 in capital gains in those 9 months resulting in a  24% total return.  I think $25 is a fair price because that puts the yield at 130 bps higher than the fixed rate CIM-A, more than enough additional yield to compensate for the potential for rate decreases.  However, $25 is roughly the maximum share price as CIM can redeem the shares at $25 at anytime after 3/30/24.  I wouldn’t be surprised if CIM does redeem the shares, a win for investors.

CIM-B is far from risk free, but I think the potential for a quick 9 month profit is worth the risk.  CIM owns residential mortgages.  Not the type guaranteed by Freddie or Fannie. If you remember the Big Short’s quote of dog shit wrapped in cat shit.  CIM owns the dog shit.  It’s not as bad as 2007.  The mortgages have low loan to value (LTV) as mortgage standards are tighter and the housing market has had considerable appreciation since the mortgages were written.  The job market for subprime mortgage customers is strong.  CIM has minimal leverage allowing it to handle delinquencies.  

It’s not a risk free 24% 9 month return, but I’m comfortable with it.

Here’s the CIM [investor presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a0f938f160fc1c8a4f78fe77ecb8044f/chimerareit/db/862/7941/pdf/Investor+Presentation+June+2023_Final+%281%29.pdf)

I encourage you to look up the details of CIM-B  at QuantumOnline.com.  Benefits of CIM-B include cumulative dividends (if CIM can’t pay preferred dividends, they accrue and must be fully paid before their common stock can pay a dividend.). CIM is an mREIT that must pay out 90% of profits to maintain its tax status, meaning the preferred stock dividends must be paid.  Not a tax advisor, but every mREIT dividend I’ve seen qualifies as a 199A tax break effectively leading to dividends taxed at only 80% of your marginal tax rate.

If you want more ideas like CIM-B, here’s my previous posts.

8,Company Discussion,stocks,Is $META going to benefit from Threads?,166,0.79,"One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company’s value?

The answer isn’t simple, and I’ll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.

Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).  
  
From Meta’s point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.  
  
If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:

**Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**

The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.  
  
Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn’t be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.

Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:

\- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.

\- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn’t use its potential)

\- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon’s lawyer) for creating a “copycat” app.

&amp;#x200B;

Meta's value will increase, only if:  
  
\- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;

\- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.  
  
I personally, do not think the new platform is creating a lot of value for Meta.","Is, META, Threads",META

11,,stocks,Rising Real Yields Threaten High-Yield Companies’ Share Prices,7,0.68,"A surge in US real yields, reflecting the return on bonds adjusted for inflation, has raised concerns among investors about the implications for riskier assets such as stocks. The yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities (Tips) reached 1.82% on Friday, the highest level since 2009, as investors increasingly anticipated the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates to combat inflation.

Real yields serve as a vital indicator of borrowing costs throughout the economy, influencing the relative attractiveness of risky assets. The recent surge in real yields has made low-risk government debt more appealing, thereby diminishing the attractiveness of other investment options. This rise in borrowing costs is reminiscent of last October when bonds experienced a sharp sell-off, coinciding with a period of greater uncertainty surrounding US inflation.

The repercussions of this increase in real yields pose a significant risk to the corporate sector. Debt acquired when interest rates were at or near zero may now require refinancing at much higher rates. Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International, explains that the problem arises when companies need to refinance debt that was initially borrowed in a low-interest rate environment.

For instance, a high-yield company that secured funding at around 4% during the pandemic may now face interest rates exceeding 12%. The impact of this sudden increase in borrowing costs could be severe for these companies as they grapple with the financial burden of refinancing their debt at significantly higher rates. Such a shock to the financial system can exert downward pressure on the affected company’s share price, potentially leading to increased volatility in the equity market.

Furthermore, analysts anticipate that the effects of higher borrowing costs will be more acutely felt in the latter half of next year and into 2025. Many companies took advantage of slashed interest rates during pandemic lockdowns to secure loans, supporting the economy. However, with lending already slowing down this year, the tighter financial conditions resulting from rising yields may amplify the challenges faced by businesses.

The implications of these shifting monetary and financial conditions are not limited to individual companies. Investors are growing increasingly concerned about US equity valuations as financial conditions tighten. The relationship between stock prices and returns compared to Tips is changing. Jon Day, fixed income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, highlights the need for higher equity returns to match the rising real yields. The disparity between expected equity returns and the current market conditions is a significant factor behind the recent stock sell-off triggered by the Fed minutes.

While equities have experienced substantial gains this year, largely driven by investor enthusiasm for companies leveraging artificial intelligence, some investors question whether a buoyant stock market and apprehensive bond investors can both be correct.

Overall, the surge in US real yields carries substantial implications for various aspects of the financial landscape. The shock of higher borrowing costs for companies that raised funds at lower rates during the pandemic can significantly impact their share prices. 

Additionally, the slowdown in lending, coupled with tightening monetary and financial conditions, raises concerns about the valuation of companies. As investors grapple with these uncertainties, the relationship between stock prices and real yields becomes a crucial factor to watch in the coming months.","Rising, Real, Yields, Threaten, High, Yield, Companies, Share, Prices","REAL,BHC,PSMT"

14,,stocks,Never loosing indicators(?),0,0.29,"Hi redditors,

I have a stupid question with a standard obvious text-book answer goes like ""are you dumb?."" But I am curious anyway about your creative ways of saying it.

I have a friend who I know for a long time and he is interested in stock market for the past few years. He is looking for indicators and trying to apply them to different indicies, shares, CFDs etc. Recently his claim was that he found never loosing indicators. His argument is that those indicators work with 5mins intervals on some assets and 1 hour in some others. They involve having put and call options depending on what indicators signal with the current market value, volume trend etc. 

He makes all the hyper-parameter optimization using past data and further proposes that, in 1 to 2 year time windows, he could have made 40%, 50% and even 100% net  profits using these indicators including comissions etc. When we ask why there is that much gain but absolutely no risks, his argument is okey in the long run if not making 50% 100% profit then 25% 30% is still free money that one should get.

I am a novice trader who is learning and enjoying it and consider it as securing my today savings' purchasing power for the future. Besides I have my day job and I find it too stressful to make high frequency trades. Even in slow pace, I think it is sometimes stressful. All things put asside, when I check public funds managed by pros and their performances, they don't make 50% 100% net profits every year. If this is something that obvious such that one guy realize at home looking at the graphs, then why not everybody is making this as their only job? Paradoxically, if everybody applies the same and simple tactic, then no one could have won. Anyway...

So the general rule for etf investing is to choose safe etf investing like a broad market index like sp500 or a total world index like $VT.

If a VT index or sp500 weren't available. What would you chose? Basically they are deemed be relatively low risk. Now if you wanted something risky with ETFS. Does that exist?

I have the basic total index and 50% other side in sp500 for ""safe"". If I couldn't choose that, I'd go for something like Personally I'd for a mix of mid cap, small cap &amp; QQQM.

 That would probably yield more returns then a broad market but be more aggressive? Or something like a clean energy and ai etf bring more returns? Basically what would you choose for an Etf combo ( if you can't choose sp500 - or need to overlay with sp500)","How, ETFs",HWM
18,,stocks,"Unveiling the Economic Puzzle: Change in Rate Expectations, and Economic Indicators.",7,0.77,"Over the past two weeks, a comprehensive set of economic data has provided economists and investors with a detailed understanding of the US economy. Notably, today’s market reversal was driven by a shift in market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate, presenting a challenging path forward for the stock market and raising uncertainties.

The latest labor market data revealed a hint of tepidness in the June nonfarm payrolls report. Job growth of 209,000 fell slightly below consensus expectations, and revisions showed a net gain of 99,000 jobs, signaling a slower pace compared to previous months. This suggests that the ongoing reduction in the M2 measure of money is gaining traction and beginning to impact the economy. Tight monetary policy, as a result of the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle, is starting to have an effect.

Despite the softer labor market data, it is unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates at the upcoming July 26 meeting. Civilian employment, including small-business start-ups, rose by 273,000, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.6%. Average hourly earnings increased, and total hours worked saw an uptick, reinforcing the belief that the Fed perceives the need for further stabilization of the economy through additional rate hikes.

A divergence becomes apparent when shifting focus to the goods and services sectors. The ISM Manufacturing index continued its contraction for the eighth consecutive month, reflecting concerns about a slowing US economy and reduced customer demand. In contrast, the ISM Services index rose to 53.9 in June, with fifteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth, surpassing even the most optimistic forecasts. While signs of a potential recession loom, the services side of the economy appears to be holding up for now, with business activity and new orders within the services sector remaining in expansion territory.

International trade data indicated a decline in the trade deficit for goods and services to $69.0 billion in May, accompanied by decreases in both imports and exports. This aligns with forecasts of a recession, reflecting weakened domestic demand for goods and a shift towards increased spending on services. Import numbers from China have plummeted by 24.3% compared to the same period last year, resulting in China slipping to the third-largest exporter to the US behind Mexico and Canada. Falling daily freight rates further indicate a weakened global trade environment.

The most significant market impact today was driven by new expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate. The provided data reveals an increasing probability, now at 92.4%, of the target rate falling within the 525-550 basis points range. This shift in rate expectations has led investors to reassess their strategies and pricing models, incorporating the potential impact on various asset classes.

Though rates off recent highs, this week's still-large backup in yields reflects fears of a more aggressive Fed and continued global tightening (though market pricing continues to forecast only a single July rate hike before the Fed pauses).

Considering the implications for the stock market, the outlook appears uncertain. The ongoing slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with reduced demand and inventory buildup, raises concerns about future factory output. Persistent inflationary pressures, as indicated by the prices index within the manufacturing sector, pose challenges for companies.

As the market adjusts to shifting rate expectations and economic indicators, caution should be exercised. The stock market may face downward pressure as it navigates these uncertainties, potentially impacting company valuations and investor sentiment. Market participants are urged to closely monitor developments, adapt investment strategies accordingly, and remain diligent in risk management.

The message the world’s top central bankers delivered late last month could not have been clearer. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, and his US and eurozone counterparts Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde, all insisted that high inflation — and high interest rates — would endure.

The impact of the shifting economic landscape and changing rate expectations will mainly impact cyclical stocks, stocks particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. Cyclical stock industries include automotive, construction, technology hardware, manufacturing, consumer durables, housing, airlines, travel and leisure. The slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with potential rate hikes, could present challenges for companies within these sectors.","Unveiling, Economic, Puzzle, Change, Rate, Expectations, Economic, Indicators","FMX,FMX"

&gt; Stocks fell on Friday, and finished lower for the week, as Wall Street struggled to shake off fears that the Federal Reserve may start hiking rates again later this month.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.29% to end at 4,398.95, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.13% to close at 13,660.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 187.38 points, or 0.55%, to settle at 33,734.88.
*****
&gt; All three major averages capped a losing week. The S&amp;P dropped 1.16%, while the Nasdaq declined 0.92%. The Dow shed 1.96% for its worst weekly performance since March.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department’s June jobs report showed payrolls increased less than expected, cooling down from May. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 209,000, while the unemployment rate came in at 3.6%. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated 240,000 positions added and a similar jobless level.
*****
&gt; But parts of the report, including stronger-than-expected wage numbers, heightened fears that the central bank may have reason to resume hiking later this month. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% in June and 4.4% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined from 3.7% in May.
*****
&gt; “It’s kind of a mixed picture today,” said Truist’s Keith Lerner. “It’s good news that the economy is not falling apart, it’s still chugging along, but you still have these wage pressures that are going to keep the Fed likely to raise rates at the end of the month.”

&gt; Near term, Lerner said equities are ripe for a pullback following a big June and second quarter. This could lead to consolidation and choppy action as markets head into earnings season.
*****
&gt; Following Friday’s big data release, traders kept their bets on a resumption in hiking later this month, pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point hike on July 26. Those are about the same odds as a day ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.

&gt; # Stellar NASDAQ 1st Half Dampens July and Q3 Performance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2ff76af69a1691d77dc884e4bcd1c2d9/7b1ae60421497f18-3e/s500x750/e83d26bb66b714c132d4b619a7964df03e674810.jpg))**

&gt; NASDAQ finished the first half of 2023 with a stellar 31.7% gain. This is NASDAQ’s third best first half ever. Only 1975 and 1983 were better. In the following table we compiled all years since 1971 when NASDAQ was up 20% or more in the first half. Reviewing the table, we observed only two times out of the past eleven where the second half of the year was better than the first half (1999 and 2003). July and Q3 were also below average following a 20%+ first half gain while Q4 was better than average.

&gt; This reinforces our existing tepid outlook for Q3. Today’s much stronger than anticipated jobs data has increased expectations for another Fed interest rate hike and added more uncertainty as to when the Fed will eventually pause. Increasing uncertainty is likely to lead to more volatility and a sideways to possibly lower market during the historically weak third quarter.

&gt; # Big Picture: The Economy is Normalizing

&gt; We started this year discussing how the economy has been at the “edge of normal” in our 2023 outlook. The good news is that we have slowly but surely moved towards normal since then, even in the face of a banking crisis and debt ceiling drama. The “soft” economic data from sentiment surveys have been poor, but the “hard” data that measure actual employment, sales, and production, have painted a much brighter picture.

&gt; We discussed last month how we combine a lot of the economic data into our own proprietary leading economic index (LEI), which we produce for 30 countries around the world, each one custom-built to capture the dynamics of those economies. The individual country LEIs are also subsequently rolled up into a global index to give us a picture of the global economy. The idea is to give us an early warning signal about economic turning points. Simply put, it tells us what the economy is doing today and what it is likely to do in the near future.

&gt; For example, our index for the U.S. includes 20+ components, including consumer-related indicators (which make up 50% of the index), housing activity, business and manufacturing activity, as well as sentiment and financial markets data. This contrasts with other popular LEIs, which are premised on the fact that the manufacturing sector and business activity/sentiment are leading indicators of the economy. This worked well in the past but is probably not indicative of what’s happening in the economy right now.

&gt; Right now, our LEI suggests the US economy is growing along trend, or slightly above it. The economic picture looks even better than it did at the end of 2022. Six months ago, the risk of recession was higher, though even then, the LEI didn’t say that we were in a recession, or even very close to one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-US-LEI-675x800.png))**

&gt; However, we’re seeing some interesting dynamics under the hood.

&gt; # 2022 Headwinds are Fading
&gt; As I mentioned above, our LEI has been consistently saying that the U.S. economy is not in a recession. That was almost entirely thanks to a resilient consumer, with strong employment gains powering incomes and consumption. Pushing against this was an aggressive Federal Reserve and tighter financial conditions. Consequently, the sector that took the biggest hit last year was housing, followed by a slowdown in business spending and manufacturing activity.

&gt; But a turnaround looks to be happening now.

&gt; As you can see below, the LEI has been rebounding over the last few months. That’s come on the back of declining headwinds from housing (yellow), business/manufacturing activity (green), and financial conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-LEI-breakdown-667x800.png))**

&gt; In fact, housing has moved to being a positive contributor! We’ve written about how why we believe housing will no longer be a drag on the economy after 8 straight quarters of pulling GDP growth lower. Even business activity is exerting a lower drag on the economy – we just wrote last week about how investment has been rising recently, hopefully signaling a bottom.

&gt; Financial conditions appear to be easing, especially with the Fed moderating the pace of rate hikes and interest rates inching close to their terminal level for the cycle.

&gt; Most importantly, consumption remains positive, though less so than a few months ago. This is not really a concern in my opinion (at least, not yet), as it simply indicates that consumption trends are normalizing. The latest contribution from consumption to our LEI is equivalent to its pre-pandemic contributions.

&gt; Ultimately, the big picture is that the economy looks to be finally normalizing after a few years of being whipped around by the pandemic, and its after-effects.

&gt; # Factory Orders Go Negative

&gt; The last 24 hours have been rough for economic data both in the US and around the world as most indicators released have been weaker than expected. It started with weaker-than-expected PMI readings for the services sector in China but has since spread to weaker PMI readings for most major economies in the Eurozone as well. Here in the US, PMI data on the services sector will not be forthcoming until tomorrow morning, but Factory Orders released this morning were a big miss. At the headline level, orders for the month of May increased 0.3% which was a half percentage point below consensus expectations. Not only that but April’s reading was also revised down from growth of 0.4% down to 0.3%. After stripping out Transportation, Factory Orders declined 0.5% while April’s reading was revised from a decline of 0.2% down to a drop of 0.6%.

&gt; On a year/year basis, Factory Orders also dipped into negative territory for the first time since October 2020. The chart below shows the historical y/y change in Factory Orders since 1960. While readings were negative during every recession, there were plenty of other periods where they also declined on a y/y basis and the economy was nowhere near a recession. Not only that but there were also many other periods during economic expansions where Factory Orders dropped by a much larger amount on a y/y basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/070523-Factory-YY.png))**

&gt; While the magnitude of the decline in Factory Orders hasn’t been extreme, what is unique about the current period is how long the rate of change in Factory Orders has been declining. The chart below shows streaks where the y/y change in Factory Orders increased (blue line) or declined (red line). With May’s report, the rate of change in Factory Orders on a year/year basis has declined for a record eight straight months, breaking the prior record of seven months that was seen during recessions in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and during the Financial Crisis. The fact that prior streaks of similar duration all occurred during recessions isn’t exactly reassuring. What makes it less worrisome, though, is that the decline is coming after Durable Goods experienced record growth and consistency of growth coming out of the COVID crash.

&gt; There's plenty of evidence out there to cite as reasons why the US economy is teetering on the edge of a recession or merely in a slowdown, and parts of today's Factory Orders report could honestly be used to help justify either viewpoint.

&gt; # Why July Brings the Bulls

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” -Abraham Lincoln

&gt; And with that, the first half of the year is a wrap. What can we say other than all those calls for a recession and new bear market lows sure didn’t play out. We were one of the only places predicting there wouldn’t be a recession this year and to look for stocks to possibly gain 12-15% (and maybe more with some good news). It was a lonely call and we took a lot of heat for it, but we are noticing more and more shops are coming over to the no-recession camp.

&gt; I noted in Why a Sunny Second Half of 2023 is Likely some reasons to expect more gains after the big start to this year. Well, here’s another angle on that. I looked at all the years that were up more than 10% at the midpoint of the year, but were also negative the year before. In other words, a potential slingshot move. Sure enough, stocks did even better when this took place, with the S&amp;P 500 higher those final six months eight out of nine times and up a median of 12.4% – well above the median final six month return of 7.7% when those first six months gain more than 10%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-6-800x488.png))**

&gt; So, can this surprise summer rally continue? As Honest Abe would say, might as well be an optimist and we think it can, as July historically is a strong month. Of course, it isn’t just about seasonals, as the realization the economy may not be going into a recession and a Fed that is likely done hiking are both also positives, which should keep things moving higher in July.

&gt; For starters, stocks have gained 9 of the past 10 years in July, with no month sporting a better average return over the past decade than the 3.3% July gain for the S&amp;P 500. Why is this you ask? The one thing I keep thinking about is July kicks off Q2 earnings season and in the past 10 years overall we’ve seen a lot of doubt out there. It is likely that earnings come in better than expected, calming many of the fears and allowing for a rally. We think that could happen once again this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-5-800x342.png))**

&gt; Let’s be clear though, July is usually a good month in the middle of the weak summer months. The chart below shows this nicely. Since 1950, stocks gain 1.3% on average in July, but this goes up to 2.2% in the past 20 years and 3.3% in the past decade. Pre-election years are a little weaker, up 0.9%. Lastly, when stocks gain more than 3% in the usually weak June (15 times since 1950), stocks gain only 0.8% on average and are higher only 8 times. So, there could be the chance June steals some of July’s gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-3-800x338.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we’ve shared the next chart many times the past few months, as it suggested the potential for a summer rally when very few expected it. We call this the Carson Cycle Composite, as it is a proprietary indicator that combines the past 20 years, pre-election years, the third year of a new President, and years that saw stocks gain at least 5% in January (like ’23). As you can see, a rally in July is normal and we don’t believe ’23 to be any different.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-4-3-800x283.png))**

&gt; We want to be clear, at some point stocks will take a well-deserved break. August, September, and October usually can see this volatility and it very well could happen again this year. But we remain overweight equities and we’d use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity exposure.

The *overwhelming sentiment* was more pain in 2023, with the market starting to recover in late 2023. The sentiment for Q1 was pretty much unanimously negative. From what I can see, pretty much ZERO people predicted a strong rally in Q1/Q2.  People who predicted any kind of positive gains in 2023 were downvoted (sort by controversial).

**Today, after 6 months, SPY is up +16% and QQQ is up a staggering +40%.**

I hope this helps to demonstrate how difficult it is to predict the market (and yet people do it with such confidence every day, just look at the prediction thread). Take everything you read on this sub with a massive grain of salt.  NOBODY knows what the market will do next. The people who get hurt the most in the market are the ones who believe they do.

Investing is one of those strange things where the more research you do and the more trades you make, the worse you tend to do.  Women tend to outperform men simply because they are more likely to just buy and hold.  In fact, in one study the demographic that performed the best was those who had passed away, since they were unable to make any trades.  The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.

As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF's and hold long term.

29,Advice,stocks,Nobody is going to warn you about what’s coming,1061,0.86,"It’s sort of funny seeing everyone stressing out about Fed interest rate hikes, inflation, recession, etc. 

Isn’t it true that all the known economic  risks that people are discussing today are priced into the markets? If the risks are in the minds of the public long enough then it is less likely to occur, or won’t be as severe. 

In the history of the stock market, it seems as though the biggest crashes and worst disasters were black swan events that obviously nobody saw coming at the time. 

In January 2020 nobody warned me about the pandemic 

When everyone was pumping speculative, high-growth tech stocks in late 2020, nobody warned me that the bubble would burst months later 

In January 2022, when people were discussing the market outlook for the new year, nobody warned me that Russia was going to invade Ukraine. 

In the Fall of 2022, when the market sentiment was god awful, and the media was spewing doomsday articles, nobody warned me that was the bottom of the bear market, so far, for stocks and crypto. 

Nobody warned me about that regional banking crisis in March 2023 

Nobody warned me before Toys R Us went out of business 

Nobody would have warned me in 2007 about 2008. 

Obviously, hardly anyone could have warned me about the events above and that’s the point. 

I’m convinced that when the next severe recession does eventually hit, weeks or years from now, the catalyst that triggers it will not be anything we’re discussing now. The biggest threat to the economy and stock market today isn’t the Fed or inflation. 

If anyone “warns” you about what’s going to happen they’re only trying to protect their money, not yours.

31,Company Analysis,stocks,Zoom $ZM is in trouble,12,0.69,"I am still in the process of gathering more information and writing the long-form post that I do once a week, but I thought to share some quick insights.

I think **Zoom ($ZM)** is in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Zoom benefited significantly from the pandemic, as the demand for its products surged. The revenue growth in 2020 was 88%, followed by 326% in 2021 and still an impressive 55% in 2022.

*\*Fiscal years ending January*

However, the pandemic is behind us, and so is Zoom’s growth. During the fiscal year 2023, the revenue was up $293 million (roughly 7%). But this isn’t the bad news. To understand what is actually happening, we need to take a look at the operating expenses, especially one group - **Selling &amp; Marketing.**

The purpose of this expense is self-explanatory.

Well, it increased from $1.1 billion to a whopping $1.7 billion in 2023 (from 28% to 39% of revenue).

Let me make it clear, Zoom spent $1.7 billion on Selling &amp; Marketing, and increased its top line by less than $300 million!

This is the simplified conclusion. The reality is a bit more complex. The $1.7 billion brought a lot more revenue, not only the net increase. What we’re missing in this equation is the revenue that was lost during the year, due to cancellation of the Zoom plans. Although this doesn’t exist as a separate data point, it is quite clear that the management decided to focus on not reporting revenue loss during the year by doubling down on Selling &amp; Marketing.

However, this has an impact on its margins.

This increased expenditure reduced their operating margin to roughly 6% from 25% in the previous two years.

The response that many will have is: *“So, all the company needs to do is, reduce the Selling &amp; Marketing expense, and their profitability will go up, right?”*

Well, profitability, in terms of higher margins, is likely. However, it will come hand in hand with lower revenue. 

Zoom is not only not a growth company at this moment, but also one where the management needs to decide between keeping its market share and actually delivering returns to the shareholders.

I was recently looking over some financial statements for Disney and noticed on their balance sheet they carry a significant amount of ""goodwill"":

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|31,269.0|80,293.0|77,689.0|78,071.0|77,897.0|

As i understand, ""goodwill"" is added to the balance sheet when a merger/acquisition of 2 companies occurs. So, for example, if Disney bought My Cable Company for $100 million, and My Cable Company had assets of $90 million and liabilities totaling $15 million...making the present value of the company $75 million. This would mean Disney could record $25 million of ""goodwill"" on the balance sheet.

By this logic, does that mean Disney is continually shelling out cash for companies at a price higher than their current value? Presumably in hopes of increasing future revenues?

#[Stock futures are little changed as investors look toward Friday jobs report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Friday morning, as investors refocused their attention on the upcoming June jobs report and the implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy stance.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped by 0.2%. Levi Strauss shares tumbled 7% as the denim giant cut its profit outlook for the year.
*****
&gt; This week’s main event for economic data looms ahead: the Labor Department’s June payrolls report, which is due Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate an increase of 240,000 positions, a cooldown from May’s gain of 339,000 jobs.
*****
&gt; Investors are on high alert for signs that the central bank will tighten policy even further. Traders now forecast a 91% chance the Fed will raise rates at its July meeting, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is signaling a willingness to keep tightening, but markets aren’t convinced it will happen as much as the Fed projects,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, wrote in a bond market update. “The gap between the peak rate implied by the dot plot and market expectations has narrowed but hasn’t closed.”
*****
&gt; The major averages slipped Thursday after data from ADP showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June. That figure far exceeded the 220,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; The ADP results spurred worries about the Fed’s next steps. Bond yields spiked during regular trading Thursday, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury — which is most sensitive to the central bank’s policy —touching its highest level since 2007. Stocks also fell, as the 30-stock Dow shed more than 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.8% each.
*****
&gt; The three major averages are on their way to a losing week. The S&amp;P 500 is off by about 0.9%, while the Nasdaq is on pace for a 0.8% decline. The Dow is the underperformer of the three, tracking for a 1.4% loss.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Also, I am wondering if anyone has any experience with situations like this in general. Is it common for companies in this position to have their stock price go to zero and go bankrupt? Will people likely start pulling all of their money out of the stock as the delisting date approaches?

52,Discussion,StockMarket,"Beware of the Base Effect, after July the inflation rate is not so rosy",59,0.89,"The calculation of the inflation rate can be a bit tricky because it is measured on a year-over-year basis, making it highly sensitive to the base effect. The base effect refers to the inflation rate in the corresponding period of the previous year. If the inflation rate was very low in that period, even a small increase in the price index will result in a high rate of inflation now. Conversely, if the price index had risen significantly in the corresponding period of the previous year, a similar absolute increase in the price index now will show a lower inflation rate.

While this may seem like a minor mathematical detail, it has a profound impact on our understanding of inflation and can potentially mislead us about the likelihood of reaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% inflation or even fuel deflation concerns.

Between July 2021 and July 2022, the cost of goods and services (in absolute terms, expressed in dollars) increased sharply (as shown by the red line) but at a significantly slower pace (as shown by the green line) after July 2022.

[Image 1. CPI \($\). Source: FRED \(adapted\). ](https://preview.redd.it/plknmbelpkab1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35b909047eb0c0ca293d961fffc9a2dbb1bdc548)

In order to calculate the inflation rate over the past 11 months, we  have been comparing prices from the red line with prices from the green  line. Due to the substantial difference between these trends, it becomes  easy to reduce the inflation rate, as depicted in the next image (Image  2: CPI YoY %).

[Image 2. CPI YoY \(&amp;#37;\). Source: yCharts.com \(adapted\)](https://preview.redd.it/3gufhiyppkab1.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d2d09959128041aab5211154a59071b0c6679628)

It's important to note that prices were not decreasing in absolute terms, and despite the positive headlines regarding inflation reduction, what you are observing is primarily the base effect at play. So, contrary to what individuals benefiting from inflation, such as Elon Musk and Cathie Wood, may have told you, we are not even close to experiencing a deflationary process.

Starting from July 2023, the inflation rate will be calculated using CPI data (Image 1) from the green line only. As a result, it will become increasingly difficult to achieve lower inflation rates. Reaching an inflation rate lower than 3% will be nearly impossible unless significant demand destruction occurs in the near future.

Historically, achieving significant demand destruction without causing a recession has been challenging. It is possible to reach the 2% target or avoid a recession, but achieving both simultaneously is highly unlikely.","Beware, Base, Effect, July","BASE,EFTR"

I will have a pre market and my weekly TA up at night time. 

Well after what looked like a day that could go either way we got some pretty strong economy data and market algos took that as an opportunity to dump… now of course though that dip was bought right up…

Tomorrow we get the all important unemployment data… IF we see an uptick in UE we can almost guaranteed a pump…. If that UE is lower than expected we likely will see a huge dump again.

Today we finally put that supply in that we were looking for… there is a new supply at 443.14 which now takes out 442.55 supply… we now have a huge no mans land from here to 431.37 demand. 

From a strictly supply and demand stand point… I would lean bearish over bullish… only because we haven’t actually put in a new daily demand and DMI is still in the process of waving down. While this could tomorrow bounce green and turn todays candle body low of 439.43 into a new demand if you are taking a trade off that you are guessing not waiting for confirmation. 

I see two scenarios… we either continue to the 20ema near 435.51 tomorrow and likely tomorows candle body low will become a new demand…. Or we do indeed turn 439.43 into a new demand tomorrow and look to push back to 443.14 and potentially 447.02.

Price action wise its 50/50 here again… 

On a bearish stand point we did break through the black bull channel we have been in since the first week of May. We also closed below the daily 8ema. That with a new daily supply and daily dmi wave down all would make me feel bearish. 

However, on a bullish stand point we finally gap filled last weeks gap, we bounced before the daily 20ema and have a massive wick on this abandoned baby candle… this candle should result in a reversal back to the upside. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.14 -&gt; 447.02  
 Demand- 431.37 -&gt; 429.86  
 Support- 438 -&gt; 435.9 -&gt; 432.3

We also here finally get that supply we have been looking for. With a double top and new daily supply at 4493 with a daily DMI wave down our next target should be either 4374 demand or a new daily demand. That would lean us bearishly for tomorrow. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dz6g3p69peab1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=99fe77bb0ab1aab45928b8b08ee629daaf4222cb

Futures daily here also broke through its bull channel support that dates back to first week of May. Now this daily candle structure is much different and we actually have move of a hanging man candle than doji… this one doesn’t look as strong bullish/ reversal like as SPY to me…

We also did close under the daily 8ema here too. With no new daily demand and daily dmi waving down the general thesis would be bearish but bulls very well could turn immediately around and double bottom us off 4448. That then would set up a very bullish next week. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4492 -&gt; 4312  
 Demand- 4374 -&gt; 4537  
 Support- 4447 -&gt; 4434 -&gt; 4414 -&gt; 44374

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rq8yckm9peab1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d3c422f029a465a5be855bd73a8ba2b2b979578c

QQQ did put in a new daily supply today also but the biggest difference is that we actually reconfirmed a previous supply (370.39) as supply… that now makes this 370.39 area a major resistance to watch. 

QQQ has that similar daily hanging man/ dragonfly doji candle set up that would make one believe in an upside push tomorrow… however without a daily demand or daily DMI wave up it is very speculative still… 

QQQ daily did break that yellow bull channel for the first time since April 19th… with that support broken… we now find ourselves in the green bull channel. 

QQQ did actually hold and close over its daily 8ema… this is a very 50/50 daily here… For me I lean bearish until a new daily demand is put in. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 371.41 -&gt; 370.39 -&gt; 357.09  
 Demand- 357.6 -&gt; 377.48

**VIX**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z8wujm5apeab1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3db2291cc0042b00e6bfb10e818dc63032bb3e01

The VIX had a monstrous day today and took out the 16.06 demand… the VIX was up about 20% at its peak I believe… 

However, today once again because a buy the dip moment and as you can see the VIX just completely unwound. So where does this leave us… well if you remember I have said that if SPY and VIX have opposing candle patterns which spy has a bullish reversal set up and now the VIX has a bearish reversal set up (massive evening doji star) then the odds would actually be slightly better for a green day tomorrow on SPY. 

I do see a scenario if we get the green SPY bounce tomorrow that the VIX would unwind… if the VIX unwinds we likely put in a new supply at 15.46 which then we would look to take out 15.01 -&gt; 14.51 and 14.1 supplies tomorrow or early next week. 

If we see SPY put in a new daily demand and the VIX put in a new daily supply then I would be fairly bullish as we head into next week and CPI next week.

I took a ton of trades today… 25 I believe… was able to put in another small green day today too… 

Today was a bit of an experiment for me… as you can see I traded SPX and QQQ… so spx has been struggling a lot lately and well I have been wanting to trade QQQ for a while now just to see if I could get in on it better or not…

Today was a learning experience for sure as QQQ does interact with the EMAs on 1, 5 and 15min slightly differently and also I noticed the overall movement can be less smooth compared to SPY… but the biggest thing I noticed is that actually compared to spy I actually had a higher win rate and more profits… now granted its only one day… 

A few other things I noted today is that I basically while almost always entering spy and qqq together doubled my position size on accident/ purpose… 

A few things of struggle this morning… the early trades in the day I had my 5% stop loss on still and that was far too tight and led to basically 2 immediate stop loss hunts… 

I struggled a little bit this morning mostly as I was looking for the v bottom recovery that came much later… the biggest struggle today honestly was stop loss. I bit terribly into the bear trap around 130 (which does make me more bullish for later) but the worse part about that is the fact that I had calls for the breakout around 2pm and I had some really nice 5-6% profits on my SPY and QQQ calls… in the end call it being trusting or being greedy but I didn’t secure them and well we got massive stop loss hunted before it ripped… I was able to jump back into some calls and win back the loss and then some but still frustrating…

That honestly is the hardest thing about these level to level plays is that you have to hold with conviction to the next level… however you cant hold with such conviction like I did that you end up letting a green play go red… the other fine line is stop losses… you want them tight enough that you dont get massive losses that you cant recover but also not so tight that you get hunted all the time… 

Overall the last two days were a good stride in the right direction… haven’t had back to back green days since June 14th and 15th…. Now again I recognize not the greenest of days and I had a few different opportunities to close with about $200-300 in profits but continued to trade… however, every day is a learning experience and I continue to learn more about these L2L plays and how to properly capitalize on them. 

I am indifferent on whether I will continue to trade QQQ or not… in the end QQQ and SPY move honestly very similar together. One could argue that QQQ is too much noise… but one could also argue that they and their options move far enough different to justify it… I will continue to trade both and continue to see what happens… I did enjoy that there were quite a few times that I noticed SPY would not push up and it was due to the fact that short term (1/5 min) QQQ was in a bearish movement… they move together enough that its worth keeping an eye on both… I will have to monitor next week whether I feel is worth trading both at the same time like I did today… tomorrow I will focus soley on SPX as I will be mobile and only using my laptop.

Is it a wise strategy to keep doing what I’m doing, or start small positions monthly into high dividend funds each month so by the time i retire I have a large chunk of money in a dividend fund.

Here are some highlights from the minutes…

·  Fed Minutes: Some participants indicated they favored or could have supported raising the target rate 25 basis points.

· FED: ALMOST ALL OFFICIALS EXPECTED MORE RATE INCREASES IN '23

· Fed Minutes: Those favoring an increase noted very tight labor market, stronger-than-anticipated economic momentum, little evidence of inflation being on a path to return to 2% target over time.

· Fed Minutes: Fed staff saw a mild recession as likely to start later this year, same as in may minutes.

· Fed Minutes: All participants agreed maintaining a restrictive stance would be appropriate.

· Fed Minutes: Almost all participants stated that upside risks to inflation outlook or possibility inflation expectations might become unanchored remained key to policy outlook.

· FED MINUTES: 'SOME' FAVORED HIKE, BUT WENT ALONG WITH PAUSE

· Fed Minutes: A few participants noted potential for upward pressure on money market rates as treasury increased bill issuance, which might lead to lower use of on RRP facility.

The biggest thing I see here from FOMC Minutes is we really got no new information… nothing really unexpected… however, I do find it interesting that so many were okay with a rate hike despite the pause…

Now looking at the next two months of Cleveland fed inflation nowcast…. Next Wednesday is already CPI! We believe it or not…. Are actually expected to see a nearly 2% drop! That’s insane… So how are markets going to react when we a 2% drop when currently a 25bps rate hike is expected? 

Now what I really care about is that CORE CPI YoY is only expected to come down by 0.2% at most and CORE MoM actually will likely be unchanged… if you remember the fed had mentioned that they care far more about CORE right now as that obviously is having a lot more trouble unwinding that actual CPI is…

Because I enjoy analyzing trends… of the last 5 post FOMC minute days (October 12th was actually CPI day so I don’t really count that)… 2 out of 5 opened red and we average a 0.39% +/- open…. We also closed red only 2 out of 5 times… 

Whats super intriguing to me… the days FOMC minutes closed red… spy has actually closed green the next day and vice versa… trend would suggest a red closure today on SPY means green closure and open tomorrow…

Well I was looking for a new daily supply to be put in today and there was a few different times we were attempting to… however, we did not get a new daily supply… Though what I find most interesting is the fact that we did start a daily DMI wave down though…

I was pretty tempted to swing some puts overnight but I ended up not since there was no new daily supply… as of right now support remains at 442.55 and next resistance is 447.02 until a new supply is put in… 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Not much going on right now on SPY daily… I do see a potential M pattern setting up here though… if it does set up and play out we could look to target 429.8 next week. 

We actually interestingly enough and painfully enough have closed within a $2.45 cent range for the last 3 trading days now. 

Overall we continue to ride the daily 8ema support upward and after 5 green days in a row we did (barely) get a red closure today. Looking for a small sell off and potential gap fill before we continue our push upward. Honestly it feels like SPY is pretty much in no mans land and no direction land right now. 

A closure under 441.4 tomorrow and I start to target 438.1… closure over 443.9 and im looking for 447. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 442.55 -&gt; 447.02  
 Demand- 431.37  
 Support- 441.4 -&gt; 438.1

We also did not get a new futures daily supply today but we did get the daily DMI wave down… it actually is a bit intriguing seeing ES bounce off the daily 8ema like this and bounce off that 4469 supply.

Similar pattern here on futures, however, the big difference I am seeing here is that we actually have a double top with a bearish engulfing candle… now generally I would say this is bearish… however, this one actually is looking bullish… and here is why.

Generally a double top means we fall lower… however, we actually are back testing and holding the Friday resistance and turning that into support at 4283 and we also closed out a hammer candle… this bounce and wick off the daily 8ema with a back test to turn previous resistance into support is actually bullish… there is a very real possibility we bounce off the 4283 area and double bottom to clos over 4494 tomorrow. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4469

QQQ actually managed an impressive 0.00% close today… technically a red day due to the -$0.01 drop… but I actually find myself a little more bearish on QQQ than I do SPY… we are looking at a really nice double top off this 370.39 supply and really if you look at the June 15th candle this is now a triple top… 

We however on QQQ did not start a daily wave down on DMI nor did we get a new daily supply… QQQ from that stand point could actually see further upside before downside… 

However, as long as bears hold this under 370.39 supply my target remains the downside. 

A drop tomorrow could and would reconfirm this 370.39 supply… that would be very bearish and a strong resistance level to watch. 

Since June 12th QQQ has closed within a $15.2 or about 4.25% range every day…. SPY has closed in the same time period within a $12.6 or about 2.93% range… 

For me I would not long QQQ until we close over 370.39 (but really 371.41) and I wouldn’t short this until an official new supply is put in. 

**VIX**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oobbxfmm7ab1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=80a1da9d4e91c28fa5e09530f5ae23b85532977f

I had mentioned that the VIX had indeed put a new daily demand in at 13.5 and that my target would be 14.1 to 14.51 on the VIX… that pretty much played out perfectly and we nearly hit that 15.01 supply… 

The VIX actually has a pretty textbook bearish abandoned baby reversal candle set up here… which means the VIX very well could gap down tomorrow. The VIX with a red day tomorrow and honestly with this massive upside gravestone doji candle it should be expected… will put in a new supply at 14.21 which then takes out 14.1 supply… we then would start to target 13.5 on the VIX. 

It is very notable that the VIX rejected and failed to close over the daily 20ema.

Quite the roller coaster of a day today… the morning (prior to 1130) honestly started off really good and I was pretty satisfied with things. However then it just got choppy and untradeable… 

The worst time of the day for me was around 1230. After an incredibly convincing and what I would call an A++ set up I entered a call and pretty much out of no where spy went on a massive drop and stopped me out… Of course me being silly and expecting continuation of trend I then entered puts after things looked strong to the down side and was then of course stopped out… 

Without those two plays that honestly not much you can do when things dump out of no where or things don’t continue… today woulda been a really solid day… 

End up with a small green day… but overall I would say mentally today was a good day from a confidence stand point… I did play things pretty well a few times and read some entries and exits nicely… Premiums once again did not reward us very much which should be expected when we are barely moving $2 intraday. 

One big change I did make today was I initially moved my stop loss from -10% to -7%... generally speaking lately on these plays it seems I am either 100% correct or 100% wrong… after the first 2 or 3 plays I ended up just looking at a -5% stop loss as my new standard. 

I used 5dte today which is technically 3 dte today and I did like the movement on them. I did feel I could have used 2dte a few different times but I also don’t want to be on too short of a dte… the DTE is something I will continue to monitor over time… as of right now 3rd day expiration appears to be a nice sweet spot… honestly SPY as a whole just needs to see some actual intraday movement.
