0,0.81,882,Meta Threads is Missing one important thing Twitter has... PORN!,"Meta stock is already up on pre market because of instagram threads.

i think all the changes twitter is having right now like limiting the number of posts you can watch and other changes are really bad and will probably heavily damage the site.

Threads came exactly in the right time when twitter make all those bad changes that will probably cause many users to leave.

The thing that's missing however is all the xxx rated stuff twitter has.

let's not be hypocrite here and be honest.many people watch this type of entertainment -

The Porn Industry is a 97 billion worth industry.

This a major disadvantage for threads and while it is great we're getting an alternative it won't be the same because Twitter doesn't have censorship on xxx rated materiel while Threads does have censorship.

i think threads still have potential to be successful but the censorship might limit the potential success.

2,0.8,40,"Sometimes the best thing to do is set it, forget it ... even if a recession is possibly near","So I wanted to share a quick thought. I am a 30 yo investor and also am a trader. I have different brokerage accounts set up for different things. Brokerage account A is for my long term investing (just in VOO and QQQM). I throw $300 into it every paycheck and have for years. This is my set it an forget it account. This account will someday be almost for sure worth a lot more than it is. Brokerage account B is for trading and I like to swing trade (I never day trade). I will wait for extremes in the market (i.e. in March 2020 I bought up Wayfair and Amazon stocks due to the lockdowns and people buying from home being the norm for awhile). 

I have a Brokerage account C that is only dividend paying ETFs but I am not going to talk about that account right now on here. I opened up both brokerage accounts A and B in 2017 when I began to have throw money available. An almost down to the dollar amount has been added to both brokerage accounts. Are you ready for the rate of return comparison? Before I give it I want to say a few things: Brokerage account A took me less than 2 hours of research to decide which 2 ETFs to throw my money in. This is again just investing in 2 ETFs (VOO and QQQM). I click ""market"" and then ""buy"" and I purchase as much of these 2 ETFs equally as quickly as I can when I get a paycheck and have money left over. This takes no time at all. Brokerage account B has probably taken me hundreds of hours of research, I have lost sleep (both because of having really good days and really bad days - like when I bought NIO 16 months ago). 

Rate of return of brokerage account A since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.1% 

Rate of return of brokerage account B since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.2% 

That is it. All of the hundreds of hours of starting at Finviz screens. All of the times of comparing a stock to another stocks PE, forward PE, company debt, etc etc has yielded me a 0.1% difference to the upside. If I could go back in time I would have been better off just throwing money into brokerage account A. One of the reasons I have not done better in account B is because there are many talking heads out there who swore we would be in a recession, akin to 2008 (25% - 30% down from all time highs). It reminds me of the many talking heads in 2010, then in 2011, then in 2012, then again in 2013 who swore we would have a double dip recession and that the rally in 2009-2010 was inflated. Well that was not true - a person would have been better off just investing in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, etc in an ETF and not trying to gamble with which company will do good and which will not.

7,0.99,11,Fintech/Digital Banks Rising in the Checking Account War.,"Does this trend change the mind of an investor to lean on the side of Fintech Banks vs Traditional Banks?  Which side would you invest more in and why?

A recent study by Cornerstone Advisors showed the increasing trend of Americans opening Fintech checking accounts:

* In the first half of 2023, Fintech/Digital Banks captured nearly half (47%) of all new checking accounts.
* Fintech/Digital Banks' growth is coming at the expense of large banks.
* Chime and PayPal represent 20% of all new checking accounts opened in 2023.
* In the first half of 2023, SoFi’s market share quadrupled to 4% from 1% in 2020 while Wells Fargo’s share dropped by more than a half to 3.5%.
* Young Americans dominate new checking accounts opening in 2023 with 72% being Gen Zers or Millennials

The article continues by emphasizing the trend of more percentage of Americans opening new checking accounts.  Megabanks may not feel the pain as they have more affluent consumers and many may have more than one checking account.  However, the article goes further and stated that megabanks should feel the pain because the percentage of consumers using them as their primary checking account provider is on a decline.  This declining trend spreads to regional banks, community banks, and credit unions as they all are losing their share of being Americans' primary banking providers.

Apparently, more than a third of Gen Z and Millennials, and nearly thirty percent of Gen X consider Fintech/Digital Bank as their primary checking account provider.  The reasons for this Fintech/digital trend are:

1. Young consumers pay with many available digital methods.
2. Fintech/Digital Banks offer a multitude of products within their ""checking account.""
3. The Fintech/Digital Banks often offer more metrics to measure financial health and performance.
4. The percentage of assets spent on marketing is much higher by the Fintech/Digital Banks for brand awareness.

The second ETF is less well known and is not on top of people's minds to the same degree.

&gt;Embracer raises $182 million via share issue

&gt;The group issued 80,000 new shares and revised its net debt target to SEK 8 billion ($729 million) by the end of FY2023-24

&gt;Embracer has raised SEK 2 billion ($182 million) by issuing 80,000 new shares.

&gt;The share issue targeted Swedish and international institutional investors, the company said in its announcement, with a subscription price of SEK 25 (roughly $2.25) per share.

&gt;In a release published prior to the share issue yesterday, Embracer said that upon completion the initiative will help the company revise its net debt target to SEK 8 billion ($729 million) at the end of FY2023-24.

&gt;CEO Lars Wingefors commented: ""The operational and financial performance of the business remains on track according to the management expectations driven by a strong performance of the Dead Island 2 during the first quarter of 2023. The execution of the restructuring program communicated on June 13, 2023 goes according to plan. The company hereby reiterates its full year Adjusted EBIT forecast of SEK 7-9 billion."" ($638-821 million)

&gt;Embracer clarified that it preferred a share issue rather than a rights issue as the latter ""in the current market would entail a risk that the company cannot provide for its capital needs while maintaining its desired optimal capital structure.""

&gt;A rights issue would also expose the company to a risk of ""a significant depressed share price,"" Embracer added, saying that a share issue was ""the most suitable alternative.""

&gt;Wingefors said: ""The strong support from both existing and new investors in this share issue proves a firm belief in Embracer Group’s strategy to become a stronger company by unleashing the significant untapped potential in the group.

&gt;""While the restructuring program is developing according to plan, the proceeds from this share issue will further strengthen our financial position, improving both financing cost and our operational flexibility, and enabling us to focus on the key aspects of the program. Ultimately, this will empower our entrepreneurs and creators to continue to deliver outstanding and memorable experiences to gamers and fans across the globe.""

&gt;Embracer announced a restructuring program mid-June as its debt reached SEK 15.6 billion ($1.45 billion) as of March 31, 2023.

&gt;The program led to leadership changes, with Saber CEO Matthew Karch resigning to become the firm's COO, and Crystal Dynamics' Phil Rogers named chief strategy officer.

&gt;In its financial results for FY2022-23, Embracer's sales were up 79% year-on-year but Wingefors described the 12-month period as ""challenging"" as a $2 billion deal collapsed due to ""external factors.""

&gt;Last week, SJN Insight's Sam Naji reflected on the group's restructure announcement, and pondered whether the IP Embracer owns can fortify its future.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday as Wall Street resumed a holiday-shortened week and awaited Federal Reserve meeting minutes coming in the afternoon.
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday following a losing session on Wall Street, as traders continued to weigh the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 153 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.4% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
&gt; JetBlue Airways slipped 1.2% in the premarket after the company announced it would end its partnership in the northeast U.S. with American Airlines to focus on Spirit Airlines. American shares moved 1.6% lower, while Spirit added 2.9%.
*****
&gt; The shortened trading week resumed Wednesday after a break for the Fourth of July holiday. The major indexes logged modest losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 129.83 points, or 0.38%, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.2%. Both indexes snapped three-day win streaks. The Nasdaq Composite finished 0.18% lower.
*****
&gt; Wall Street also combed through minutes from June’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where members opted to skip a hike. The latest findings showed that most officials would support more increases ahead.
*****
&gt; As of late Wednesday, traders are pricing in a nearly 89% chance of a hike at the central bank’s meeting this month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; “Fed chair Powell has made it clear that he is absolutely committed to seeing this 2% target reached, and so, I think it pretty much means that it’s a when, not an if, as far as additional hikes are concerned later this year,” CIC Wealth’s Malcolm Ethridge said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects two more hikes from the Fed this year, likely in the third quarter. Ethridge, executive vice president at CIC Wealth, also noted that while inflation’s showing signs of cooling it will take time to reach the 2% target.
*****
&gt; “No matter which side you fall on, we can all sort of agree that not enough has meaningfully broken to this point that would signal that they’re going to back off of the gas pedal and allow us to coast from here,” he added.
*****
&gt; Given this setup, investors aggressively positioned in this market for their time horizon or risk appetite may want to use periods of strength to take profits, he said.
*****
&gt; The shortened trading week continues Thursday with a slew of fresh economic data points, including ADP private payrolls data for June and initial jobless claims. A reading of S&amp;P Global services PMI and ISM services PMI are also on deck.

Failure to do so may result in a liquidation of the unpaid security(s) which could result in a 90-day free ride restriction (90-day freeze).

20,0.5,0,Is it too late to invest in Meta? How do people gage when it's too late?,"I'm looking into a few different companies to invest in. I noticed the continuous rise in META and I'm wondering if it's too late to make a Stock investment. If it is too late, how can i determine if it's too late myself, for other stocks? I'd presume company position matters, Meta is pooping out tons of new products and announcements which I presume is what's contributing to this continues rise, but from using Graph knowledge alone, is it possible to roughly estimate the max a Stock will hit? I'm not planning on doing day-trading, just setting up accounts for the future. Thanks for any help.  


Also relatively new to Trading so if anyone fancies berating me, feel free 😂 I'd love the extra knowledge. ",Advice Request,0

22,0.33,0,What Bell or Communication company will gain the most?,"In 1996 then President Bill Clinton signed into law The Telecommunications Act of 1996. This law eventually paved the way for the creation of CLECs. CLECs force fair competition. Around 12-13 years ago Comcast was allowed to enter the market with no regulations, causing a major ripple effect in business class Voice and data. My only opinion on that is they are a good Cable company. In the past year the Telco provides, aka the LECs, such as ATT, Lumen, Verizon have been granted authority by the FCC to abandon prior agreements to minimize work on the copper infrastructure and to force the hands to move to Fiber in questionable areas. As someone that is on the CLEC side of this I can only express dissatisfaction in how this was handled. Carriers have opted to charge 200-700% more than they did prior to fit each copper facility and of course as a provider one must pass the increase along. In all I feel this is more a rant but also curious to know how the business minded people see this and if anyone follows Telecom stock who will gain the most from this?",,0

25,0.4,0,Recommended Motley Fool alternatives?,"So it seems that the whole of reddit hates the Motley Fool, despite it being the top listed stock advisor in many articles after searching on Google.

If the Motley Fool does indeed suck, what would you recommend as an alternative? I was looking at IDB and their composite score. I am looking to invest for the long term.

26,0.4,0,Stock logical thinking,"Trying to confirm my logic here:

If I bought at 250  
and sold at 260

Then I buy back in at 270, does that mean I lost money? 

My thoughts:

It terms of actual money, I'd only be losing money if the stock drops below 270. Now in terms of opportunity cost, then yes I did lose the difference between 270-260. 

Is this the right way to think about it?

27,0.38,0,Can somebody help explain why Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is struggling this week? Down 1.5% when it seems as though it should be trending up,"I’m relatively new to investing and own 4 shares of ATVI (big bucks, I know). I was under the understanding that the Microsoft FTC trial last week had played out well for Microsoft and Activision, pending Judge Corley’s final ruling. On top of that, Diablo IV (a live service game based in longevity) was announced as the fastest selling Blizzard game of all time and has surely passed $1bn in sales ($666m was announced within the first week of release). Their quarterly earnings report is due by the 31st of this month and I’m confident that Diablo pre-orders and sales will reflect on that. So why has the movement on share prices only gone down this week? Any insight would be appreciated, I am seeking education on the topic more than anything.

28,0.26,0,My trading dilemma,"So i have started trading in 2020, am the type of a guy that love learning the hardway in any spectrum. Unfortunately hardway in trading mean losing lots of money. I lost almost 30K out of pocket and 60K out of profit total of 90K in 3 years.

After 6 months of trading i started learning about leverage and options. 

I pulled so many homeruns and 3xs ROIs.
My last trade i turned 1K to 5K in a week.
But as usual i think i will lose it due to my high profit target and lack of discipline and revenge trading. 

Note that i also do seminars on how and why you need to invest also have more than 2K followers. I know that i have great knowledge with investing, stocks and crypto but for some reason its hard to implement.

So my question to you guys should I quit trading/investing ? as it’s mentally and financially draining.",Advice Request,0
