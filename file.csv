i think all the changes twitter is having right now like limiting the number of posts you can watch and other changes are really bad and will probably heavily damage the site.

Threads came exactly in the right time when twitter make all those bad changes that will probably cause many users to leave.

The thing that's missing however is all the xxx rated stuff twitter has.

let's not be hypocrite here and be honest.many people watch this type of entertainment -

The Porn Industry is a 97 billion worth industry.

This a major disadvantage for threads and while it is great we're getting an alternative it won't be the same because Twitter doesn't have censorship on xxx rated materiel while Threads does have censorship.

In February, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House Republican, bought stocks in Lockheed Martin, Chevron, and NextEra Energy. Mere days later, the Ukraine conflict escalated. Other politicians followed suit, buying up oil and defense stocks before the Ukraine invasion.

In July, Nancy and Paul Pelosi sold all their Nvidia stock. By August, Nvidia was instructed by the US to limit chip sales in China and Russia, causing the stock to drop 20%. When questioned about the timing of her sale, Pelosi remained silent.

Senator Thomas Carper bought bearish ETFs before significant rate hikes and CPI data from the federal reserve. Interestingly, he sits on the Senate Finance Committee, and his positions have profited.

Congress members also heavily invested in semiconductors prior to the passing of the CHIPS bill and restrictions in China. This led to significant gains for them in 2023.

Dan Crenshaw was questioned about his stock trades, including a sale in February that brought him a 32% return. In response, he implied that trading was a way for Congress members to better themselves.

In 2022, both Pat Fallon and Tom Suozzi faced STOCK Act violations for late disclosures of trades worth hundreds of thousands, but the House Ethics Committee dismissed their cases, citing lack of clear evidence of intentional non-disclosure.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/quantitative-tightening-qt-qe-federal-reserve-balance-sheet-global-liquidity-2023-7

Ballooning debt in the coming years will force the Federal Reserve to buy massive amounts of bonds again, according to Michael Howell, managing director at Crossborder Capital.

Writing in The Financial Times on Wednesday, he predicted that the central bank will have to abandon its quantitative tightening plan, which would roll back prior stimulus by shrinking the Fed's balance sheet. Instead, the Fed will return to its quantitative easing scheme, lifting stocks in the process, he added.

""Investors should therefore expect a continuing tailwind from global liquidity instead of last year's severe headwinds. This should prove good for stocks, but less positive for bond investors,"" Howell said.

Despite forecasts of a looming funding drain, the liquidity cycle has already passed its bottom and will trend up over the coming years, he said.

Howell noted that the Fed and other central banks earlier this year plowed liquidity into the global financial system during this spring's banking turmoil, which was caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

""But in coming years they will probably have to bailout debt-burdened governments, too,"" he warned.

According to Howell, about seven in every eight dollars churning through global markets are already used for debt refinancing. And of the remaining dollar, a growing portion is going toward expanding government deficits.

That's as developed economies are being faced with fresh pressure to expand public spending, as a renewed focus on military requirements and changing demographics weigh on budgets, he explained.

""In a world of excessive debt, large central bank balance sheets are a necessity. So, forget QT, quantitative easing is coming back. The pool of global liquidity — which we estimate to be about $170 trillion — is not going to shrink significantly any time soon,"" he wrote.

According to Congressional Budget Office estimates cited by Howell, the Fed's Treasury holdings would have to rise to $7.5 trillion by 2033 from nearly $5 trillion today.

But he thinks that forecast is too low.

""More realistic numbers point to required Fed Treasury holdings of at least $10 trillion. That translates pro rata into a doubling of its current $8.5 trillion balance sheet size and will mean several years of double-digit growth in Fed liquidity,"" he wrote.","Forget, Fed",FDX
8,Advice,stocks,Nobody is going to warn you about what’s coming,562,0.84,"It’s sort of funny seeing everyone stressing out about Fed interest rate hikes, inflation, recession, etc. 

Isn’t it true that all the known economic  risks that people are discussing today are priced into the markets? If the risks are in the minds of the public long enough then it is less likely to occur, or won’t be as severe. 

In the history of the stock market, it seems as though the biggest crashes and worst disasters were black swan events that obviously nobody saw coming at the time. 

In January 2020 nobody warned me about the pandemic 

When everyone was pumping speculative, high-growth tech stocks in late 2020, nobody warned me that the bubble would burst months later 

In January 2022, when people were discussing the market outlook for the new year, nobody warned me that Russia was going to invade Ukraine. 

In the Fall of 2022, when the market sentiment was god awful, and the media was spewing doomsday articles, nobody warned me that was the bottom of the bear market, so far, for stocks and crypto. 

Nobody warned me about that regional banking crisis in March 2023 

Nobody warned me before Toys R Us went out of business 

Nobody would have warned me in 2007 about 2008. 

Obviously, hardly anyone could have warned me about the events above and that’s the point. 

I’m convinced that when the next severe recession does eventually hit, weeks or years from now, the catalyst that triggers it will not be anything we’re discussing now. The biggest threat to the economy and stock market today isn’t the Fed or inflation. 

If anyone “warns” you about what’s going to happen they’re only trying to protect their money, not yours.

17,Company Discussion,stocks,IBM acquisiation of Apptio,207,0.94,"IBM revealed that it would pay $4.6 billion to Vista Equity Partners to buy the software business Apptio.The business said that IBM's investment in AI and IT automation software is being continued with the purchase of Apptio, which provides financial and operational IT monitoring and optimisation solutions. Apptio will help IBM develop its application management, optimisation, and observability solutions, the company claimed in a release.  
Based on Reuters, Apptio’s revenue is about $233m in 2018, and an annual compound of 10% would lead to an estimated revenue of slightly more than $300m. IBM has paid for 15 times Price to Sales Ratio for Apptio’s business, and it seems to be an overpayment given that their revenue generation is only $300m. Furthermore, it is not disclosed on whether Apptio is profitable and generating free cash flow. For comparison, PE firm Vista Equity Partners agreed to acquire Apptio for $1.94 billion in 2018, and IBM has paid for more than twice of that amount in the span of 5 years. This would amount to 1-2% of IBM’s market cap which shows that the acquisition is slightly material to business, especially since it is an all-cash acquisition.  
Considering that it is an all-cash acquisition by IBM, it makes one wonder whether the cash could have been put to better use, instead of overpaying for Apptio. Nevertheless, the CEO of IBM believes that Apptio's offerings combined with IBM's IT automation software and watsonx AI platform, gives clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize and manage all of their technology investments.   
Historically, IBM does not have a good track record of their acquisitions. An example would be their acquisition of Weather Co for $2bn in 2015. Currently, there are rumours that IBM is looking to sell their Weather business, with an estimated valuation of $1bn. This leads to a negative loss of $1bn, and it also shows that the acquisition did not went well.

**Why it matters**: The rally — which some argue is the early stage of a new bull market — reflects relief that inflation has eased without a recession, as well as a dash of AI hype for a bit of speculative spice.

**By the numbers:**

* The S&amp;P 500 is up 14.5%.
* The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index is up by 29.9%.
* The small-cap Russell 2000 — driven by expectations for the U.S. economy over the relatively short term — is up by 6.8%.

**Context:** After an awful 2022 — the S&amp;P's 19.4% fall was its worst since 2008 — investors were pretty darn bearish coming into this year. And for good reason...

* Inflation was still over 6%.
* More Fed rate hikes were expected.
* As a result, almost everybody was predicting a recession — and atrocious corporate profits.
* Oh, and there was the not-insignificant risk that the U.S. would default on its debts, setting off a financial crisis.

**Yes, but:** Things worked out OK. Inflation is now 4%, and the Fed took a breather on rate hikes. A debt ceiling deal got done, and the U.S. economy is a lot stronger than many expected. Corporate profits were fine.

* Even the worst banking panic since the financial crisis, which broke out in March with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, didn't weigh on the market for long.

**Be smart:** There's an old aphorism on Wall Street that stocks like to climb a ""wall of worry.""

* Translation: Stocks tend to rise when investors start out as pessimists but grow gradually more confident when ugly scenarios they worried about don't come to pass.
* This is basically what's been happening in 2023

**What they're saying:** ""The 2023 trend is like other ""wall of worry"" bullish turns in 2020 (COVID-19), 2019 (US trade war with China), 2016 (Brexit vote and Trump elected President), and 2013 (Eurozone debt crisis),"" wrote analysts of BofA Global Research this month.

**What's next:** Some think the continued rally hinges on whether the remaining bears can be gradually transformed into bulls

Japan launched a new stock index on Monday, making it easier for investors to identify corporate value in the equity markets, in a move to strengthen corporate governance reforms in the world’s third-largest economy. The new JPX Prime 150 Index is a curated list of the 150 constituent listings on the Tokyo Exchange, which includes the likes of tech giants like Sony Group, Hitachi, Nintendo and Warren Buffet-backed trading houses Marubeni, Itochu and Mitsui &amp; Co.

The Prime 150 index constitutes about half of the Japan stock market and are of similar quality to the S&amp;P 500, Miura said.

|31,269.0|80,293.0|77,689.0|78,071.0|77,897.0|

As i understand, ""goodwill"" is added to the balance sheet when a merger/acquisition of 2 companies occurs. So, for example, if Disney bought My Cable Company for $100 million, and My Cable Company had assets of $90 million and liabilities totaling $15 million...making the present value of the company $75 million. This would mean Disney could record $25 million of ""goodwill"" on the balance sheet.

By this logic, does that mean Disney is continually shelling out cash for companies at a price higher than their current value? Presumably in hopes of increasing future revenues?

|Operating profit (in $m)|$2,230|$4,125|85%|
|\# of shares outstanding (in b)|1,187|1,116|\-6%|

Twice the size, 27% cheaper.

One of the main reasons for this is the negative sentiment around the company due to the increased competition (Google Pay, Apple Pay, Stripe, etc. ) and the expectations that the future of PayPal isn't as bright as its past was. I think this is a fair concern and should not be ignored.

I describe PayPal as a fintech company, that offers solutions related to online financial transactions, digital wallets, and revolving credit. Of course, there are plenty of other solutions that are part of the portfolio, but if we take a look at the revenue stream, it is quite clear where the value comes from:

\- Transaction revenues **(91%)**

\- Other value-added services **(9%)**

In my opinion, there are 3 important variables to understand how PayPal's ability to generate revenue changes over time:

1. Number of users
2. Number of transactions per user
3. Average transaction size

The higher these numbers are, the more revenue PayPal has.

&amp;#x200B;

**The formula**

I went back to 2014, and the data is quite clear, the management has done an outstanding job and despite the competition, PayPal continues to grow:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The number of users is up from 161 million to 435 million.
2. The number of transactions per user is up from 24 to 53.
3. The average transaction size remains at $60.

&amp;#x200B;

In the most recent year, the growth comes less from user growth and more from an increase in # of transactions per user.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance &amp; the acquisitions effect**

The revenue in the last twelve months (ending March 2023) is up 58% compared to the full 2019 (less than 5 years ago). Although the gross margin has decreased from 45% to 42%, the operating margin stands at 15%, as the operating expenses have decreased (as % of revenue).

However, I will argue that this profitability is understated due to the acquisitions that they've done.

PayPal is no stranger to acquiring companies to improve its ecosystem and of course, some have performed better than others. However, to understand the impact on the company's profitability, let's take the acquisition of ""Honey"" back in 2020.

PayPal paid $3.6 billion for it and here's what it got on its balance sheet in return:

1. Goodwill $3 billion
2. Customer lists and user base $0.1 billion
3. Marketing-related technology $30 million
4. Developed technology $0.6 billion
5. Receivables, deferred tax liabilities, other net liabilities -$0.1 billion

What does this mean and why is this important? When a company is being acquired, in most cases, there are certain intangible assets that arise. In this case, I am referring to points 2, 3, and 4. These assets weren't on the balance sheet of Honey, as they are internally generated, and the accounting standards do not allow for capitalization (Otherwise, everyone would do it, which would lead to overstating the profitability).

These intangible assets will be amortized in the income statement of PayPal over a certain period of time. From an accounting point of view, this is a non-cash expense throughout the amortization period. However, PayPal is not going to invest in order to replace them. The customer lists will remain there, and so will the technology. This accounting expense doesn't exist from a cash point of view.

This is how much amortization of this kind was in PayPal's financials over the last 3 years:

2020: $451 million

2021: $443 million

2022: $471 million

These amounts represent roughly 2% of PayPal's revenue.

So the operating profit is actually closer to 17%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Returning cash to the shareholders**

As PayPal is a profitable cash-generating company, one of the questions that need to be asked is - What do they do with all the cash?

Well, other than acquisitions. The answer is - share buybacks. The # of shares outstanding continues to decrease every year, as PayPal buys back more shares than its share-based compensation. The company will spend $3.5 billion until the end of 2023, and there's $14.4 billion in total remaining from the existing buyback program (20% of the outstanding shares).

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions and valuation**

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my assumptions for the future:

**Revenue growth**: 7% per year over the next 2 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 64%.

**Operating margin**: 16% (slightly lower than the operating margin that the company has at the moment)

**Discount rate**: 10.1% decreasing to 9.3% over time

You might wonder, what about the competitive landscape? My expected growth is much lower than the 15% CAGR over the last 5 years. In addition, the operating margin of 16% is lower than the 16.7% operating margin that PayPal has today (adjusted for the amortization mentioned above).

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of PayPal is roughly **$71.4 billion ($63.99/share).**

For comparison, today’s market cap is $74.5 billion ($66.73/share), which is quite close.

The **expected IRR** based on my assumptions is 9.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|14%|16%|18%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($42.1b)|$52.9|$59.6|$66.2|$71.7|
|64% ($46.1b)|$56.7|$64.0|$71.3|$77.2|
|100% ($56.2b)|$64.5|$73.1|$81.6|$88.9|
|125% ($63.2b)|$70.3|$79.8|$89.3|$97.4|

The sentiment around PayPal seems to be negative as the share price is down a lot. The fear of their competitors taking their lunch is still around, but it isn't reflected in the financials. Based on all of this, I decided to open a position in the company, and should it drop further, I'll buy more.

As always, thank you for reading this post, and for all the support.","PayPal, It","PYPL,IT"
30,,stocks,How important is BRK-B not having a dividend in terms of capital appreciation without getting taxed?,56,0.87,"The more I look into BRK-B (forget A given the price) , the more I appreciate the high quality businesses invested private/public, international exposure, and a few high growth buys like NU Holdings. 

Doing full S&amp;P with getting taxed on the dividends can chip away over time I suppose. BRK does fairly routine buy backs and sitting on a ton of cash. My thoughts are if BRK drops after Warren or Charlie's passing, the probable sell off is going to be met with what I imagine STRONG buy backs at discounted deep value prices with that cash hoard they're sitting on. 

BRK.B over 20+ years with DRIP beats S&amp;P, but not QQQ. Although I do like BRK's Apple exposure, along with AMEX, banks, etc. 

Overall I think it is a great play (at least in my taxable individual account) given NO dividends, ability for buybacks at deep value. My 401k and 457b account are all VTI, and my Roth IRA is preferred stock funds with DRIP for example so feel confident. Thoughts? ","How, BRK","HWM,BRK-B"

33,Advice,stocks,5 types of stocks that make good investments:,50,0.78,"5 types of stocks that make good investments:  
  
(1) Fast Growers: Young companies with high growth potential. They are often risky, but they can also be very rewarding. They are usually small, innovative, and take on established players. They grow rapidly, but with this growth comes risk. Tesla is an excellent example, having grown immensely over the past decade despite significant risks. Owning a successful Fast Grower can turbocharge your portfolio returns.  
  
(2) Turnarounds: Companies that have fallen on hard times but are now turning things around. They are less risky than fast growers, but they also offer lower potential returns. A recent example is Chipotle. These stocks can provide big gains, but they also entail significant risks. They are high-risk, high-reward investments.  
  
(3) Stalwarts: Large, established companies with consistent performance even in mature industries. Coca-Cola is an excellent example. Owning these stocks can provide a steady stream of returns with less volatility. They are less risky than fast growers, but they also offer lower potential returns.  
  
(4) Cyclicals: These companies' profits ebb and flow with economic cycles. As their profits are closely tied to economic conditions, timing is everything when investing in these stocks. When the economy is thriving, the demand for their products escalates due to strong construction and manufacturing activity. Conversely, in a sluggish economy, the sales and profits of these products tend to decline.  
  
(5) Asset Plays: These are companies that possess underappreciated assets, such as real estate, patents, or cash. Investing in these companies can yield significant gains when the market finally recognizes the value of these assets.",,

#[Stock futures are little changed as investors look toward Friday jobs report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Friday morning, as investors refocused their attention on the upcoming June jobs report and the implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy stance.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped by 0.2%. Levi Strauss shares tumbled 7% as the denim giant cut its profit outlook for the year.
*****
&gt; This week’s main event for economic data looms ahead: the Labor Department’s June payrolls report, which is due Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate an increase of 240,000 positions, a cooldown from May’s gain of 339,000 jobs.
*****
&gt; Investors are on high alert for signs that the central bank will tighten policy even further. Traders now forecast a 91% chance the Fed will raise rates at its July meeting, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is signaling a willingness to keep tightening, but markets aren’t convinced it will happen as much as the Fed projects,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, wrote in a bond market update. “The gap between the peak rate implied by the dot plot and market expectations has narrowed but hasn’t closed.”
*****
&gt; The major averages slipped Thursday after data from ADP showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June. That figure far exceeded the 220,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; The ADP results spurred worries about the Fed’s next steps. Bond yields spiked during regular trading Thursday, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury — which is most sensitive to the central bank’s policy —touching its highest level since 2007. Stocks also fell, as the 30-stock Dow shed more than 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.8% each.
*****
&gt; The three major averages are on their way to a losing week. The S&amp;P 500 is off by about 0.9%, while the Nasdaq is on pace for a 0.8% decline. The Dow is the underperformer of the three, tracking for a 1.4% loss.

35,Advice,stocks,"Sometimes the best thing to do is set it, forget it ... even if a recession is possibly near",42,0.8,"So I wanted to share a quick thought. I am a 30 yo investor and also am a trader. I have different brokerage accounts set up for different things. Brokerage account A is for my long term investing (just in VOO and QQQM). I throw $300 into it every paycheck and have for years. This is my set it an forget it account. This account will someday be almost for sure worth a lot more than it is. Brokerage account B is for trading and I like to swing trade (I never day trade). I will wait for extremes in the market (i.e. in March 2020 I bought up Wayfair and Amazon stocks due to the lockdowns and people buying from home being the norm for awhile). 

I have a Brokerage account C that is only dividend paying ETFs but I am not going to talk about that account right now on here. I opened up both brokerage accounts A and B in 2017 when I began to have throw money available. An almost down to the dollar amount has been added to both brokerage accounts. Are you ready for the rate of return comparison? Before I give it I want to say a few things: Brokerage account A took me less than 2 hours of research to decide which 2 ETFs to throw my money in. This is again just investing in 2 ETFs (VOO and QQQM). I click ""market"" and then ""buy"" and I purchase as much of these 2 ETFs equally as quickly as I can when I get a paycheck and have money left over. This takes no time at all. Brokerage account B has probably taken me hundreds of hours of research, I have lost sleep (both because of having really good days and really bad days - like when I bought NIO 16 months ago). 

Rate of return of brokerage account A since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.1% 

Rate of return of brokerage account B since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.2% 

That is it. All of the hundreds of hours of starting at Finviz screens. All of the times of comparing a stock to another stocks PE, forward PE, company debt, etc etc has yielded me a 0.1% difference to the upside. If I could go back in time I would have been better off just throwing money into brokerage account A. One of the reasons I have not done better in account B is because there are many talking heads out there who swore we would be in a recession, akin to 2008 (25% - 30% down from all time highs). It reminds me of the many talking heads in 2010, then in 2011, then in 2012, then again in 2013 who swore we would have a double dip recession and that the rally in 2009-2010 was inflated. Well that was not true - a person would have been better off just investing in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, etc in an ETF and not trying to gamble with which company will do good and which will not.

36,Advice Request,stocks,What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,42,0.9,"I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). 

And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying 

1) where the current strength in the market is 

2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile 

3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)

For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. 

A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.  

So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms",What,WHATS.BR
37,,stocks,Prediction thread from the start of 2023 - a shining example of how bad people are at predicting the future,40,0.86,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zxbjuf/what\_are\_your\_predictions\_for\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zxbjuf/what_are_your_predictions_for_2023/)

The *overwhelming sentiment* was more pain in 2023, with the market starting to recover in late 2023. The sentiment for Q1 was pretty much unanimously negative. From what I can see, pretty much ZERO people predicted a strong rally in Q1/Q2.  People who predicted any kind of positive gains in 2023 were downvoted (sort by controversial).

**Today, after 6 months, SPY is up +16% and QQQ is up a staggering +40%.**

I hope this helps to demonstrate how difficult it is to predict the market (and yet people do it with such confidence every day, just look at the prediction thread). Take everything you read on this sub with a massive grain of salt.  NOBODY knows what the market will do next. The people who get hurt the most in the market are the ones who believe they do.

Investing is one of those strange things where the more research you do and the more trades you make, the worse you tend to do.  Women tend to outperform men simply because they are more likely to just buy and hold.  In fact, in one study the demographic that performed the best was those who had passed away, since they were unable to make any trades.  The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.

As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF's and hold long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

66,Discussion,StockMarket,"Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?",128,0.83,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA’s stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA’s stock valuation may be inflated. 

As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.

To evaluate NVIDIA’s valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company’s financial profile reveals key information:

Examining NVIDIA’s quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.

These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA’s revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company’s overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock’s current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.

	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA’s market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued.
	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA’s EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock’s valuation.
	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.

To assess NVIDIA’s valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company’s financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.

AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry’s current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.

Micron’s negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA’s valuation.

AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.

Comparing AVGO’s Annual Income Statement with NVDA’s provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:

AVGO Annual Income Statement:

	•	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million
	•	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million

NVDA Annual Income Statement:

	•	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million
	•	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million

Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.

In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO’s net income.

These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.

Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA’s current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.

Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA’s stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.

While the company’s prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA’s stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.","Is, Nvidia, Overvalued, AVGO, Boasts, Higher, Net, Income, NVDA, Yet, Lower, Market, Cap","NVDA,AVGO,2001.HK,NET,NVDA,YETI,NLY"

71,Discussion,StockMarket,"China’s Export Curbs Pose Grave Threat to Nvidia’s $1 Trillion Market Cap, Sending Shockwaves Through the Global Tech Industry",54,0.82,"China is the world’s leading producer of gallium and germanium, making any reduction in its output a significant concern for the global tech industry. The limited availability of these metals is likely to slow down production or result in increased prices for manufacturers and their clients in the technology, telecommunications, energy, and automotive sectors. As gallium and germanium are alternatives to traditional silicon wafers in specialized applications, their scarcity could disrupt the supply chain, impacting the production capabilities of companies reliant on these materials.

Gallium and germanium are among dozens of minerals classified by the US government as critical to economic and national security. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to officials and experts in China, Beijing is expected to introduce further retaliatory measures in response to the expansion of US-led controls on technology exports.

“There will be more retaliatory measures against the snowballing semiconductor export controls from western countries,” said one senior official close to the Chinese commerce ministry.

Considering Nvidia is expected to hit 11B+ in revenue for the next quarter, going from 7billion to 11billion considering their already complicated supply chain issues and this is only going to worsen the issue and make it harder for them to meet that expectation. 

Nvidia is now “priced for perfection.” The bears can point to pretty much any risk and have a valid point. as a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia is far from immune to the potential consequences of China’s export curbs. The company’s market cap of $1 trillion is largely based on its leadership in AI Chips. Nvidia could face significant challenges in maintaining its market dominance and growth trajectory.

The restrictions could impede the company’s access to critical components and hinder its ability to supply AI chips to the Chinese market, which is a major consumer of these technologies. Such restrictions would not only impact Nvidia’s revenue but also create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share in China and beyond.

Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, said the restrictions were “worrisome” for South Korean chipmakers.

“Korean companies can find alternative sources, but it will take some time . . . if you lack some materials, no matter how important they are, this could hit chip production,” he said.

Based on historical precedents, supply chain disruptions and export curbs have often resulted in market volatility and reduced investor confidence. If Nvidia faces difficulties in sourcing essential materials and encounters restrictions on selling AI chips to China, it could face a decline in market capitalization. The loss of Chinese customers alone, given their significant demand for AI chips, could have a substantial impact on Nvidia’s revenue and market value. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions may deter investors and hinder Nvidia’s expansion plans, further eroding its market cap.

China’s export curbs on gallium and germanium, along with the potential limitations on AI chip exports, pose a serious threat to Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap. The disruption to the global supply chain, which was just starting to recover. The tech sector in particular, and the uncertainty surrounding future market dynamics could undermine Nvidia’s growth and market dominance.

The recent move by China to impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium, essential metals used in chipmaking and communications equipment, has intensified the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. These measures, aimed at safeguarding national security and interests, signify a retaliatory response to the semiconductor restrictions imposed by the US. While China’s actions may have short-term implications for Chinese manufacturers, the long-term consequences will undermine Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.

74,Discussion,StockMarket,"US Risks a Rerun of the 1920s: From trade agreements to tax treaties, growing economic isolationism echoes a historical precedent.",33,0.68,"The author argues that America is currently facing two historical parallels: a new Cold War with China and a repeat of the 1920s. In the 1920s, the US experienced economic prosperity and technological advancements but turned inward, implementing protectionist policies and ignoring global economic cooperation. The author points out that the US is currently once again the dominant economic power, but it is also becoming more protectionist under the Biden administration. The US is sidelining international institutions like the World Trade Organization and opposing global tax reforms. The author believes that this isolationist mindset is shortsighted and risks undermining the alliances and institutions that helped America succeed after World War II. In contrast, China is actively engaging with the world and forming partnerships, which could give it an advantage in the ongoing Cold War. The author warns that America’s isolationism could harm its own interests and hinder its ability to win the Cold War with China.

America faces parallels with both the Cold War era and the 1920s. The isolationist policies of the 1920s led to the Great Depression and World War II. 

In the 1920s, America witnessed remarkable technological advancements that fueled its economic prosperity. Innovations like mass production techniques, household appliances, and breakthroughs in aviation symbolized the nation’s progress. However, despite these technological achievements, America’s turn towards isolationism and protectionist policies overshadowed its advancements. In the end, the benefits of technological progress were overshadowed by the disastrous consequences of the Great Depression and the subsequent outbreak of World War II. This serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of not allowing isolationist tendencies to undermine the potential benefits that technological advancements can bring.

Today, America’s retreat from global engagement could harm its own interests and hinder its ability to win the Cold War with China. By learning from history and embracing international cooperation, America can navigate the challenges of the present and secure its position in the world.

77,Discussion,StockMarket,"Beware of the Base Effect, after July the inflation rate is not so rosy",29,0.87,"The calculation of the inflation rate can be a bit tricky because it is measured on a year-over-year basis, making it highly sensitive to the base effect. The base effect refers to the inflation rate in the corresponding period of the previous year. If the inflation rate was very low in that period, even a small increase in the price index will result in a high rate of inflation now. Conversely, if the price index had risen significantly in the corresponding period of the previous year, a similar absolute increase in the price index now will show a lower inflation rate.

While this may seem like a minor mathematical detail, it has a profound impact on our understanding of inflation and can potentially mislead us about the likelihood of reaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% inflation or even fuel deflation concerns.

Between July 2021 and July 2022, the cost of goods and services (in absolute terms, expressed in dollars) increased sharply (as shown by the red line) but at a significantly slower pace (as shown by the green line) after July 2022.

[Image 1. CPI \($\). Source: FRED \(adapted\). ](https://preview.redd.it/plknmbelpkab1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35b909047eb0c0ca293d961fffc9a2dbb1bdc548)

In order to calculate the inflation rate over the past 11 months, we  have been comparing prices from the red line with prices from the green  line. Due to the substantial difference between these trends, it becomes  easy to reduce the inflation rate, as depicted in the next image (Image  2: CPI YoY %).

[Image 2. CPI YoY \(&amp;#37;\). Source: yCharts.com \(adapted\)](https://preview.redd.it/3gufhiyppkab1.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d2d09959128041aab5211154a59071b0c6679628)

It's important to note that prices were not decreasing in absolute terms, and despite the positive headlines regarding inflation reduction, what you are observing is primarily the base effect at play. So, contrary to what individuals benefiting from inflation, such as Elon Musk and Cathie Wood, may have told you, we are not even close to experiencing a deflationary process.

Starting from July 2023, the inflation rate will be calculated using CPI data (Image 1) from the green line only. As a result, it will become increasingly difficult to achieve lower inflation rates. Reaching an inflation rate lower than 3% will be nearly impossible unless significant demand destruction occurs in the near future.

Historically, achieving significant demand destruction without causing a recession has been challenging. It is possible to reach the 2% target or avoid a recession, but achieving both simultaneously is highly unlikely.","Beware, Base, Effect, July","BASE,EFTR"
78,Discussion,StockMarket,Bond fund giant Pimco prepares for ‘harder landing’ for global economy,26,0.8,"The world’s largest active bond fund manager, Daniel Ivascyn of Pimco, believes that markets are overly optimistic about central banks’ ability to avoid a recession while combating inflation. He anticipates a “harder landing” than other investors, emphasizing that increased tightening measures lead to greater uncertainty and pose a risk to economic stability. 

Ivascyn argues that the market is too confident in central banks’ capacity to quickly reduce policy rates as implied by yield curves. Despite recent rate hikes by central banks, core inflation remains high, making it difficult for them to cut rates if the economy weakens. 

Pimco is repositioning its funds to be more defensive and liquid, anticipating potential market volatility and potential opportunities in the higher-yielding space in the next few years. Ivascyn warns that this economic cycle may be different, with central banks being less inclined to provide support to avoid fueling inflation, and the transfer of risk to private markets may slow down credit valuations’ deterioration but not prevent it.

Well after a nice little vacation with family I was finally back trading today… woulda been nice to just have skipped this incredibly low volume, low range and choppy day… but lets get into the daily here… I will try and include some of the weekly stuff here as I haven’t really done an update since last Wednesday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaglhi8vxs9b1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e1808846b9d92797ec3c88e35835d4c6096bc29a

As you probably know markets are closed tomorrow and closed at 1pm today… we are met with our return on Wednesday with FOMC meeting minutes at 2pm…

So it’s a bit of a mixed bag with how FOMC minute days have gone… about 50/50 on red vs. green opens but most of the last 6 FOMC minute days have closed red…. 

**JPM COLLAR**

&amp;#x200B;

Well our new collar is officially on the books… looking at how it all went from last collar you can see we have two scenarios here… we either will see 4670 or 4215 by September. Pick your poison… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND (weekly update too)**

https://preview.redd.it/oztd1c0wxs9b1.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=120707d9c65229bfeb11c8dc01333afc923999d4

After we put a new demand (support) in last Monday at 431.37 we have not seen a new supply put in… that means favor and ease of momentum continues to be to the upside… however, it should be noted that the daily DMI is at an extreme overbought level and actually is attempting a wave down. 

We did close over and actually attempt to turn 442.55 supply from 6/15 into support today though… 

Two likely scenarios… first is we push through to 447.02 supply, reject, put a new supply in then come back down to the daily 8 ema to establish a new demand before pushing higher… second is that Wednesday we close red putting a new supply in at 443.83. That would presumably take out the 442.55 supply… we then look and wait for the next demand to put in at which time we look to be long and look for 447.02 to 452.96. 

From a weekly stand point it is notable that weekly DMI is waving down, however, we did put in a new weekly demand last week at 433.04. Next upside level is 453.23.

As you can see we are in a black bull channel yet again… we are looking for more upside here but we just put in 5 green days in a row…. Now last month we did put in 6 green days before seeing a 3 day pullback… but with fomc minutes tomorrow my assumption would be that we close red Wednesday. 

We have a pretty significant gap from 438.28 to 441.11 that we need to close (though much like the June 2nd gap that is also about $1 we could leave it open). 

I see 3 potential patterns to play out here… pattern 1= the classic M pattern which gives us a downside targets of 415-425… pattern 2= cup and handle with a target of 438.28 gap fill…. Pattern 3= 123 rollercoaster which would look for a breakout to 450. 

I honestly remain bullish on SPY… I would like to see that pullback after 5 green days but I am bullish…

Same story here on ES… we are now over the previous resistance of 4469. The next upside target is 4537. However, it should be noted that the daily DMI is about to wave down and we are looking for a new supply… a red day Wednesday would establish 4493 as a new supply… that would take out 4469 and until we see a new daily demand we would wait to go long…

Weekly ES did put in a nice double bottom demand at 4389 and we also closed over 4461. Next weekly upside target is 4451.

Futures daily looks just as strong if not honestly much stronger than SPY daily…. After riding the daily 8ema support we have officially (Friday) punched out and are riding very bullish here)… this is the tiniest of hanging man candles though which could lead to a nice retrace on Wednesday with FOMC minutes. 

Until the black bull channel breaks there really is no reason to even consider being short…

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4469 -&gt; 4577  
 Demand- 4537 -&gt; 4374  
 Support- 4483 -&gt; 4435 -&gt; 4415

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ppzzlwxxs9b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7a797e4f2d0316336735d882b6c99d42038f4b51

Looking at QQQ here very similar thing that we put a new demand in last Monday at 357.6… since then we have not put in a new supply and we unlike SPY only are on our 2nd green day in a row due to the red day it put in on Thursday. 

We pretty much finished exactly in at the supply of 370.39 from June 15th which puts a nice double top in for us… 

Bulls need to punch through 370.39 -&gt; 371.31 and then they can attempt to find 377.48. 

However, if this 370.39 becomes resistance then we will look to actually reconfirm this level as supply on Wednesday and until a new demand is put in we will look to be short. 

QQQ weekly also put a new demand in at 362.67 and that gives our next upside target of 382.9 to 384.54…. QQQ weekly DMI actually has almost completed its wave down which does make tech potentially as early as next week a buy. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 357.09 -&gt; 370.39 -&gt; 371.41 -&gt; 380.1  
 Demand- 377.48 -&gt; 357.6

This is where the VIX actually does support more of a bearish case than a bullish case… The VIX put a new demand (support) in today at 13.5….. in doing so it signals that there is upside potential. 

We should and will look for the VIX to push to 14.1 to 14.51 area. This could be our set up to put a new daily Spy/ ES/ QQQ supply in which would then take us lower… 

Long term I do remain bullish and I still am looking for 450 before 430…

The woes continue today… I mean I expected there to be choppiness with this low range and figured that my longer dte plays would do better but today was the day of the stop loss hunt….

The first morning calls I was pretty bullish on them had about 5% profits with an upside target…. I mean literally everything screamed bullishness and then we saw a wild wick and stopped me out…

Next set of calls exact same thing. Was looking bullish and on a backtest of supports… entered on the breakout and immediately got stopped out with a rogue wick…

Then we finally lost support and things turned bearish and as soon as I entered it wicked up outta no where… 

Just straight wick central. We only had about a $1.45 range today and honestly im shocked that the 2-3 dte got hit as hard as they did honestly today. I figured 0dte would decay aggressively but I was surprised to see how much the 3dte decayed and got hit today. 

Overall red day. But I mean from a strategy stand point I cant really be upset… buying a call while SPY is riding the 1min 20ema, 5min 20ema and 15min 5ema up… breaking out over the ORB (opening range breakout) resistance (with a backtest of support), VOLD 1/5min are riding 20ema support up and VIX 1/5min are falling and rejecting 20ema down… and all my SPY indicators had bullishness…. I mean right or wrong nothing I can do about a low volume and wacky movement…

Here are some highlights from the minutes…

·  Fed Minutes: Some participants indicated they favored or could have supported raising the target rate 25 basis points.

· FED: ALMOST ALL OFFICIALS EXPECTED MORE RATE INCREASES IN '23

· Fed Minutes: Those favoring an increase noted very tight labor market, stronger-than-anticipated economic momentum, little evidence of inflation being on a path to return to 2% target over time.

· Fed Minutes: Fed staff saw a mild recession as likely to start later this year, same as in may minutes.

· Fed Minutes: All participants agreed maintaining a restrictive stance would be appropriate.

· Fed Minutes: Almost all participants stated that upside risks to inflation outlook or possibility inflation expectations might become unanchored remained key to policy outlook.

· FED MINUTES: 'SOME' FAVORED HIKE, BUT WENT ALONG WITH PAUSE

· Fed Minutes: A few participants noted potential for upward pressure on money market rates as treasury increased bill issuance, which might lead to lower use of on RRP facility.

The biggest thing I see here from FOMC Minutes is we really got no new information… nothing really unexpected… however, I do find it interesting that so many were okay with a rate hike despite the pause…

Now looking at the next two months of Cleveland fed inflation nowcast…. Next Wednesday is already CPI! We believe it or not…. Are actually expected to see a nearly 2% drop! That’s insane… So how are markets going to react when we a 2% drop when currently a 25bps rate hike is expected? 

Now what I really care about is that CORE CPI YoY is only expected to come down by 0.2% at most and CORE MoM actually will likely be unchanged… if you remember the fed had mentioned that they care far more about CORE right now as that obviously is having a lot more trouble unwinding that actual CPI is…

Because I enjoy analyzing trends… of the last 5 post FOMC minute days (October 12th was actually CPI day so I don’t really count that)… 2 out of 5 opened red and we average a 0.39% +/- open…. We also closed red only 2 out of 5 times… 

Whats super intriguing to me… the days FOMC minutes closed red… spy has actually closed green the next day and vice versa… trend would suggest a red closure today on SPY means green closure and open tomorrow…

Well I was looking for a new daily supply to be put in today and there was a few different times we were attempting to… however, we did not get a new daily supply… Though what I find most interesting is the fact that we did start a daily DMI wave down though…

I was pretty tempted to swing some puts overnight but I ended up not since there was no new daily supply… as of right now support remains at 442.55 and next resistance is 447.02 until a new supply is put in…

Not much going on right now on SPY daily… I do see a potential M pattern setting up here though… if it does set up and play out we could look to target 429.8 next week. 

We actually interestingly enough and painfully enough have closed within a $2.45 cent range for the last 3 trading days now. 

Overall we continue to ride the daily 8ema support upward and after 5 green days in a row we did (barely) get a red closure today. Looking for a small sell off and potential gap fill before we continue our push upward. Honestly it feels like SPY is pretty much in no mans land and no direction land right now. 

A closure under 441.4 tomorrow and I start to target 438.1… closure over 443.9 and im looking for 447.

We also did not get a new futures daily supply today but we did get the daily DMI wave down… it actually is a bit intriguing seeing ES bounce off the daily 8ema like this and bounce off that 4469 supply.

Similar pattern here on futures, however, the big difference I am seeing here is that we actually have a double top with a bearish engulfing candle… now generally I would say this is bearish… however, this one actually is looking bullish… and here is why.

Generally a double top means we fall lower… however, we actually are back testing and holding the Friday resistance and turning that into support at 4283 and we also closed out a hammer candle… this bounce and wick off the daily 8ema with a back test to turn previous resistance into support is actually bullish… there is a very real possibility we bounce off the 4283 area and double bottom to clos over 4494 tomorrow.

QQQ actually managed an impressive 0.00% close today… technically a red day due to the -$0.01 drop… but I actually find myself a little more bearish on QQQ than I do SPY… we are looking at a really nice double top off this 370.39 supply and really if you look at the June 15th candle this is now a triple top… 

We however on QQQ did not start a daily wave down on DMI nor did we get a new daily supply… QQQ from that stand point could actually see further upside before downside… 

However, as long as bears hold this under 370.39 supply my target remains the downside. 

A drop tomorrow could and would reconfirm this 370.39 supply… that would be very bearish and a strong resistance level to watch. 

Since June 12th QQQ has closed within a $15.2 or about 4.25% range every day…. SPY has closed in the same time period within a $12.6 or about 2.93% range… 

For me I would not long QQQ until we close over 370.39 (but really 371.41) and I wouldn’t short this until an official new supply is put in.

I had mentioned that the VIX had indeed put a new daily demand in at 13.5 and that my target would be 14.1 to 14.51 on the VIX… that pretty much played out perfectly and we nearly hit that 15.01 supply… 

The VIX actually has a pretty textbook bearish abandoned baby reversal candle set up here… which means the VIX very well could gap down tomorrow. The VIX with a red day tomorrow and honestly with this massive upside gravestone doji candle it should be expected… will put in a new supply at 14.21 which then takes out 14.1 supply… we then would start to target 13.5 on the VIX. 

It is very notable that the VIX rejected and failed to close over the daily 20ema.

Quite the roller coaster of a day today… the morning (prior to 1130) honestly started off really good and I was pretty satisfied with things. However then it just got choppy and untradeable… 

The worst time of the day for me was around 1230. After an incredibly convincing and what I would call an A++ set up I entered a call and pretty much out of no where spy went on a massive drop and stopped me out… Of course me being silly and expecting continuation of trend I then entered puts after things looked strong to the down side and was then of course stopped out… 

Without those two plays that honestly not much you can do when things dump out of no where or things don’t continue… today woulda been a really solid day… 

End up with a small green day… but overall I would say mentally today was a good day from a confidence stand point… I did play things pretty well a few times and read some entries and exits nicely… Premiums once again did not reward us very much which should be expected when we are barely moving $2 intraday. 

One big change I did make today was I initially moved my stop loss from -10% to -7%... generally speaking lately on these plays it seems I am either 100% correct or 100% wrong… after the first 2 or 3 plays I ended up just looking at a -5% stop loss as my new standard. 

I used 5dte today which is technically 3 dte today and I did like the movement on them. I did feel I could have used 2dte a few different times but I also don’t want to be on too short of a dte… the DTE is something I will continue to monitor over time… as of right now 3rd day expiration appears to be a nice sweet spot… honestly SPY as a whole just needs to see some actual intraday movement.

87,Discussion,StockMarket,"US Factory Sector Continues Contraction for Eighth Straight Month, Raising Concerns of Impending Recession",15,0.7,"The latest report on the US factory sector reveals a persistent slowdown throughout June, as the overall index remained in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month. Among the details, only four out of eighteen industries experienced growth during this period. The economy is now below its pre-pandemic high, leaving little room to deny the evident slowdown.

Our analysis leads us to maintain our belief that a recession is looming, with today’s report emphasizing that the goods sector of the economy is likely to be the leading contributor. Respondents of the survey in June expressed concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and more importantly, anticipated reduced demand from customers. 

New orders index also remained in contraction territory for the tenth month in a row. Similarly, the production index fell back into contraction territory in June.

Consumers have been shifting their preferences away from goods and toward services, further exacerbating the situation. 

The combination of decreased consumer demand and accumulated inventories at retailers indicates that factory output is likely to remain sluggish. There is some positive news, as factories have managed to catch up on order backlogs due to fewer new orders and improvements in supply chains. However, the backlogs index, although showing a slight increase in June, remains near the lowest readings since the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Unfortunately, the slowdown in orders and the reduction in backlogs have started to impact employment, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction at 48.1 in June. On the inflation front, the prices index witnessed a decline to 41.8 in June, marking the second consecutive decrease after a recent upward trend.

In conclusion, the latest report on the US factory sector presents a worrisome picture of a persistent slowdown and contraction in June. With the overall index remaining in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month and only a few industries showing growth, it becomes increasingly difficult to deny the evident slowdown. This analysis strongly supports the belief that a recession may be on the horizon, with the goods sector likely to be the primary contributor. Respondents’ concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and anticipated reduced customer demand further emphasize this outlook.

Order backlogs, which have slightly improved due to fewer new orders and supply chain enhancements, they remain near their lowest levels since the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Regrettably, the impact on employment is becoming apparent, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction. Furthermore, the decline in the prices index suggests a possible easing of inflationary pressures.

Taken together, these findings paint a challenging landscape for the US economy. The accumulation of inventories and reduced consumer demand are likely to keep output sluggish in the coming months. Vigilance and proactive measures will be essential to navigate these economic headwinds and mitigate the potential impact on various sectors of the economy.","US, Factory, Sector, Continues, Contraction, Eighth, Straight, Month, Raising, Concerns, Impending, Recession","CAKE,STUPF"
